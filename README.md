Birdhouse
=========
This is the sandbox area for Client Team development and exploration of SproutCore applications, features, components, widgets, etc.

Apps in this project are intended to be experimental, though should be thought of a developmental paper trail or _exemplum_ of "how we do X" or "why not do Y like the guide says?"
